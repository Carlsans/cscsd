This plugin allow you to display the latest covid statistics and previsions for the entire world using [covidstats] shortcode on the page where you want the stats to display.

== Description ==

Note that this plugin use third party data from my website.
This data include the graphics that are generated each day by a R script and an up to date list of all the country, states/provinces and city.
I don't keep any statistics or ip address list when the files are fetched on my server.
This plugin doesn't send any of your website data or any personal information to me or to anyone.
It just display daily statistics and use a simple prevision tool.
The previsions are only informational and may be wrong.
All the php and R code will soon be available so you can modify and do whatever you want with it.
Thanks for the interest that you put in my project.
